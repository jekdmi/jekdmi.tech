This is the ultimate summer party top! It combines simplicity and comfort in its construction, yet offers intriguing texture with its lace and cable pattern.

Meet the Chorus Camisole—your must-have summer knit if you want style and a fun knitting challenge! As our final summer design this year, the Chorus Camisole features a seamless, top-down construction that’s a blast to knit and fabulous to wear.

This pattern shines through its unique construction and eye-catching border detail. Trust us, you’ll be turning heads and getting compliments every time you wear it. And the best part? Knitting it is just as enjoyable as the finished product.

One of the coolest features is that the sizing is based on your upper bust circumference, and we’ve added horizontal short-row bust darts for a fit that can cater to your particular cup size. Whether you prefer a shaped waist or a straight fit, the Chorus Camisole has you covered. And since it’s worked from the top down, adjusting the length is super easy – perfect if you’re working with limited yarn or want that ideal crop.
