The 4th addition to the Yoke Meditation Series takes your knitting journey in a fresh direction, embracing the simplicity and elegance of raglan construction. Experience the meditative flow of colourwork that cascades past sleeve separation, creating a canvas of artful transitions against the steady pace of worsted-weight yarn. As a relatively quick knit, this piece is perfect for those looking to balance their desire for intricate design with the satisfaction of a timely completion. Worked seamlessly from the top down, each stitch brings you closer to a masterful blend of comfort and style.<!--more-->
