Moon cowl is a double-layered cowl in stranded colorwork pattern that is inspired by old Latvian pagan deities: the Moon, protector of people, and Laima, the goddess of destiny.

The inner section features the cross of the Moon, signifying the 4 phases of the Moon and also the cycle of life. The outer border sections carry the sign of Laima’s broom, it sweeps away all that’s bad and evil, and wearing this sign is said to bring good luck.
