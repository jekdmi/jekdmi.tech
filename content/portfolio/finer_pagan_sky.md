This design is inspired by captivating Latvian folklore and the enduring significance of ancient Latvian symbols of strength. In the realm of Latvian mythology, the sky reigns as the eldest deity in the cult of light, encompassing the world beneath its celestial roof, embodying the essence of leading power and cosmic force.

The pattern weaves together an array of Latvian characters, intricately showcasing the sacred signs of Dievs (God), the radiant Saule (Sun), the revered cross of MƒÅra, and the ethereal elements of the Austra (Dawn) tree. These potent Latvian symbols, cherished by our ancestors for their beauty, resilience, and safeguarding properties, continue to thrive in contemporary usage.

In this second edition of the pattern, we have transformed the original DK version into an exquisitely lightweight project, perfect for fingering weight yarn. Notably, this pattern provides a range of choices, allowing you to create a snug or roomy neckline and customise between a pullover or a steeked cardigan. With an abundance of choices, this pattern offers you the versatility of four-in-one, guaranteeing countless creative possibilities.
