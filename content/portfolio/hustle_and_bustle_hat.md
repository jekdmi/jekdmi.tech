Fun, simple, and the perfect pattern for your “busy” hand-dyed yarns. Hustle and Bustle hat is inspired by the “random chaos” of the city, of people running to and fro. It features a fun, “random” (but repeated) purled texture. The purls create diagonal lines dashing in different directions that add interest to your simple knit but allow the yarn to be the true star of the knit.
