Texture and movement are two of my favorite things about knitted fabric. The Ziggy Hat captures both! The zig-zag pattern looks complex, but adventurous beginners can achieve the knitting techniques used. The 1x1 cables can easily be worked without a cable needle. A folded brim—with built-in ribbing—will keep you toasty in the winter winds.

This hat was designed for Shorn IV, a small-batch yarn made from sheep I know and love. The fiber was grown in Illinois, milled in Michigan, and is all natural in a beautifully blended gray.
