Simplistic to knit, fun to wear. Along the Shores Fingerless Mitts is an enjoyable knit with just a couple of simplistic textures inspired by the ocean. It includes the option to work a herringbone cuff or a ribbed cuff and customization instructions for adjusting the length of your mitts.

The mitts begin with a beautiful herringbone cuff, clearly linked to the herring fish. Then, the majority of the pattern is worked in stockinette stitch to represent the long stretches of sandy beaches. The top of the mitt then features a simplistic and engaging wave motif, and the mitt is finished off with a lovely I-cord bind off representing the sandy dune barriers.
