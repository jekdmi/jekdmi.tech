To encourage you to foster your self-love, Jessica has designed this shawl with an urgent message to do something special for yourself. That may be knitting a project for yourself, splurging on some fancy yarn, or adorning yourself in an elegant outfit with your favorite hand knit. Whatever self-care means to you, do it for yourself. Love yourself and show yourself that you care.

This pattern is written as a 1-skein shawl and as a 2-skein shawl. It is easy to customize, as the pattern is written as a repeat. With your purchase of the pattern, you will receive one PDF download that includes both written and charted instructions. The instructions are separated, so you can easily print only what you need!
