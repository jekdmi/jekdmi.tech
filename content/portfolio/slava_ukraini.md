The 24th of February, 2022, will be in history books as a start of an unprovoked war in Europe, not far from my homeland and by the same forces that have and still threaten my homeland. I firmly stand with Ukraine as they fight for their right to freedom and the values I share.

Iâ€™m determined to help in every way I can. As knitting is my therapy and has been the only way to find some ground during the last few weeks, I hope to connect to like-minded people with this design.

It is a tribute to the Ukrainian people and their enormous courage. It depicts embroidery motifs seen on stunning Ukrainian national costumes.

All proceeds from the sales of this pattern will indefinitely be donated to charities that my Ukrainian friends suggest as the most effective and in most need at any given time. Slava Ukraini!
