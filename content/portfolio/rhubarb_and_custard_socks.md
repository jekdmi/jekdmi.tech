Do you remember those old-fashioned sweets that were basically just boiled sugar? We used to love them as kids, and now we can wear them on our feet! These Rhubarb and Custard socks are made from the finest quality yarn, with a touch of cashmere for extra softness.

The toe-up construction means they’ll fit any foot or leg length, and the gusset sole together with the honeycomb brioche stitch heel flap add interesting details. The stranded colourwork is in the colours of rhubarb and custard, which will make you feel like you’re walking on candyfloss. Whether you’re treating yourself or someone else, knitting these socks are sure to bring a smile to your face.
