Sunshine: bright, cheery, and always ready to lift your mood. It’s no secret that summer is my favorite season (yes, even as a knitter), and that is because of the beautiful sunshine. There’s nothing like a bright, sunny day to lift your spirits and chase the blues away. Now, with the Summer in the Sun Dishcloth, we can have the summer sun brightening a day in the kitchen any day of the year!
