November of 2022 was a memorable time for my friends and me as we visited the Barcelona Knitting Festival! One of them had this brilliant idea to create matching socks with yarn purchased there, and since I call myself a knitwear designer, it fell on me to make the pattern. I felt so inspired that I only took one flight ride back home to get my first sock done – talk about positive energy!

Get ready for an adventure through your knitting needles with this toe-up construction! Slip stitches, twisted stitch cables and a sole gusset will amuse you. The eye of the partridge stitch in the heel flap adds great texture, while the short-row-shaped heel makes it even more exciting. It’s like taking a trip to Barcelona on the seafront - lots of fun twists and turns await!
