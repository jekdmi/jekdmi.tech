The On the Road Again Cowl is a quick and simple knit using DK weight yarn. It highlights a stranded colorwork motif that is designed to resemble an endless road wrapping the circumference of the hat. However, most of the pattern is worked with only one strand of yarn.

The knit is simple, easy to follow, and a bit addicting. It’s the perfect knit for the evenings when you’d like something more engaging than plain stockinette, but you don’t feel like working anything that requires much brain power.
