Whether you’re looking for an easy, brainless project to make or want something to help you relax and meditate, the Love In the Round Top is a perfect choice! There is no shaping; it’s stranded colourwork in the round at its purest. Plus, with its heart pattern, it’s impossible not to think of loving thoughts while working on it.

Even if you are looking for a little challenge, this pattern might hit the nail on the head. How about learning a new technique for catching floats? Try out the ladderback jacquard method described in the pattern. Hands down, it produces the best results.

This project is an extra treat if you have a skein of colour-changing yarn. Use it as a contrast colour in this knit, and enjoy the colour play with every row of hearts!

Last but not least, it is a very trendy accessory for styling. Wear it over your shirts and blouses for an instant fashion update. And it knits up in no time at all! Are you up for this fast project that rewards you with a trendy new top?
