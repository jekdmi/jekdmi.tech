This is the ultimate summer party top! It combines simplicity and comfort in its construction, yet offers intriguing texture with its lace and cable pattern.

Worked seamlessly from the top down, it features an angled shoulder seam at the back. The decreases in the lace pattern guide the fabricâ€™s direction, creating the rounded neckline without any additional shaping, making it straightforward to follow. You can also customise the length to your preference.
