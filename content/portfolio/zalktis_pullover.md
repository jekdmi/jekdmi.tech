Zalktis Pullover is a striking and deep-running colorwork sweater featuring an ancient Latvian sign of wisdom and bearer of blessing - Zalktis (grass snake).<!--more-->

Its construction shows off two hot trends - a turtleneck and being oversized. It is worked seamlessly in the round from the top down with raglan shaping, which means the length of sleeves and body are easily adjustable.
