This is a quick, addicting knit that is perfect gift knitting. It is not a boring knit, as every other row is changing and requires some attention. Once youâ€™ve begun knitting part of the diamond section, you will find that it is quite easy to read your knitting, and the repeat is fairly easy to memorize. Just remember to pay attention to the pattern so you form diamonds and not just straight lines!
