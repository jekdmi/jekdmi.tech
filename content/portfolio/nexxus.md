Inspired by the Japanese Boro and Sashiko techniques, the Nexxus design embodies tradition with a modern twist.
<!--more-->

Boro, meaning ‘tattered’ in Japanese, breathes new life into textiles by stitching them together in a patchwork style. Sashiko, known for its delicate ‘little stitches’, adds both beauty and functionality to garments.
The Nexxus cardigan mimics the look and feel of these ancient techniques by using mosaic and slip stitch knitting. The elegant welts framing each section, add both aesthetic and structural depth to the design.
But the beauty of Nexxus doesn’t stop there. As a palette ready for your personal touch, you can play with colors and create a one-of-a-kind masterpiece!
