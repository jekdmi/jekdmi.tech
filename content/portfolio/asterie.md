Asterie is worked seamlessly from the top down. Stitches for the neckline are cast on, then short rows are worked to raise the back of the neck.

After that, the textured yoke pattern is worked, and additional short rows are introduced to angle the neckline forward. Once the yoke is completed, the sleeve stitches are placed on hold and the body is worked in the round down to the ribbing. For the body, you can choose to work the sweater with or without horizontal bust darts and / or tapering of the body. Finally, the sleeves are worked from the top down in the round.
