‘Controcorrente’ is an Italian word that means upstream, against the tide. This wrap is knitted on the bias with strong, raised chevrons that resemble a never-ending series of waves and can be looped around the neck or wrapped around the shoulders when you want both comfort and style.

Construction:
This big, elegant, rectangular wrap is worked back and forth in rows on the bias, from one corner at a short side diagonally to one corner on the opposite short side. The natural bias of this wrap makes it a parallelogram, but it can be blocked to a rectangle easily.
