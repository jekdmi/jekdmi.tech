Windy Shores was inspired by the cold, windy shores of the Canadian coasts. The hat is comprised of an easy-to-memorize and fun-to-knit texture that represents the waves hitting the shores and splashing cold water on passersby.

The pattern is worked brim up in the round and includes instructions for lengthening the hat for a slouchier style if desired.
