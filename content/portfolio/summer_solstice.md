The Spring Solstice Top has been YEARS in the making. I initially came up with the design when I was still pregnant with my son (who is 4 years old now!). I unraveled the original, but the design kept haunting me.

So, while pregnant with our second baby, I started to knit it up again. This time, I experimented with the neckline before deciding on the v-neck. I played around with drop-shoulders and how the stitches should be picked up so I could keep it as a top-down design.

The result is a super comfy, drop-shoulder design with side slits and beautiful lace details along the bottom and sleeves. Comfortable, but classy!
