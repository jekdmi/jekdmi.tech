It's been a while since I wrote my last blog post but I had an experiment worth documenting. I had to find out for myself is it possible to make a bottom-up garment with limited amount of yarn? Want to find out too?

# Problem statement

Given:
- lanky and slim 9 years old who is very particular about her likings (aren't they all at that age? :) )
- my own pattern for [All the smallest brooks cardigan](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/all-the-smallest-brooks) stating that cardigan for size "8 years"  
needs about 750 m / 815 yds and for size "10 years" 780 m / 860 yds
- only 2 skeins available of Maruma hand dyed Merino Sport in color chosen by future wearer (in total ~ 524 m / 573 yds)
- the pattern written for bottom-up construction, meaning that you cannot easily end the knitting as soon as yarn ends.

Can the cardigan indeed be made? Let the experiment begin!


# The plan

- We measured my daugher's chest circumference and as she is very slim she would do with size **"7 years"** if no ease is required (and not that we could afford much ease in this case). So, that the size I was using for guidance.
- The easiest way to knit garments when yarn is limited is top down, so I decided to adjust the pattern instructions for that as needed
- The reason why this particular cardigan has bottom-up construction is the lace yoke, that still has to be made bottom-up not to complicate matters overly
- I would knit the cardigan in following sequence then
	- Lace yoke - bottom-up as instructions state
	- Sleeves from top to bottom - recalculating and adjusting a bit not only for age difference (9 instead of 7) but also for longer than standard arms (family trait)
 	- Remaining yarn would go to body worked from top down, as long as the yarn remain.
- The cardigan has two types of edges: garter and 1x1 ribbing. In any other cases for older kids I rarely use garter edges, I preferred them when kids where smaller, but I will use garter edge this time. Changing knitting directions is usually visible at the edges (at least in my knitting) and garter stitch would help me hide the transition point.

	
# How did I do it?

![round_yoke_unfinished](../images/round_yoke_unfinished.jpg)
*Almost finished yoke, you can see provisional cast-on with orange yarn*

To work the yoke bottom up
- I cast on using provisional cast-on the number of stitches at the widest yoke point: 244 stitches according to the pattern
- I worked the Short rows to elevate the back as stated and then the yoke according to the main instructions with small exceptions:
	- I omitted yarn over in Row 45 of the chart, making the neckline closer
- After the yoke was done, I unraveled the provisional cast-on and placed the stitches on the needles
	- Remember: the other direction usually has 1 stitch less, I chose to ignore that and "took" it from back stitches when dividing the yoke later
- I worked some rows more to adjust the yoke for the wearer, making it longer than graded for chosen size

*First fit check - not bad, but hopefully blocking will give some ease!*

- Next, I divided the body and sleeves, according to the pattern (except, giving the back 1 st more to account for the missing st from provisional cast-on)
- I did some recalculating of sleeve decreases based on the sleeve length needed and ended up with decreasing each 11th round for 9 full decreases (instead of increases as pattern instructions suggest)
- I ended sleeves with the usual 1x1 ribbing and Tubular bind-off

*Finished and blocked - view from the back*

Then, I worked the body until I felt that yarn will soon run out. At that point I worked the garter ending (1 or 2 rows more than pattern states just so I use the yarn to the maximum) and only a little yarn remains - for any potential darning needed in the future.

Lastly, some buttons sewing (I'm not a big fan of this step), blocking and voila - happy wearer!

# Consclusions

- I was only able to pull this experiment off because I have quite slim kid, otherwise, the cardigan would be just too cropped!
- Also, at the rate they are growing at this age, it will not fit long and she will outgrow it very fast as there is no additional reserve for growth.
- Hanna is happy, so am I as I was not sure that it is even possible, the difference in yardage I had and requirements is just so big!
- I could gain some ease if I would took a needle size bigger than needed for the gauge (but not much bigger so the fabric wouldn't be too loose)
- The whole affair has also given me chance to look into the pattern, discover that I outgrown the style (as it was my first garment graded) so I'm regrading it and will republish it in some foreseable future.
