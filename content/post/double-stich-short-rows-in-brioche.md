Double-stitch short rows method allows you to create almost invistible short rows in brioche knitting. You can use them in one color or two color brioche, with main or contrast color.

<!--more-->

For my sample I used two color brioche, brown is my main color and pink - contrast color. Initial number of stitches is 35, 33 brioche stitches + 2 selvege stitches.
After working several full rows, the first short row will be to 7 stitches before end of row and I will make it from both sides as it would in shaping the shoulder drop in back. Then I will make 2 more short rows on each side - 2 stitches before previous turn.
You will need 2 same size needles (DPNs or cable needles).

### Used Abbreaviations

CC - contrast color  
MC - main color  
RS - right side  
st(s) - stitch(es)  
WS - wrong side  

### Working short rows

**Short row 1 (RS).** Double brioche knit stitch:

Using MC, work in Brioche st to 7 sts before end of row. Next st is brioche knit (in MC).

**Step 1**: Insert the needle one row below the next stitch on the left-hand needle from front to the back (as if to knit):

**Step 2**: Grab the working yar and pull though as if to knit:

**Step 3**: place the new loop on the left-hand needle.

The double-stitch was just made. MC yarn thread remains behind the work.

**Step 4**: Transfer remaining stitches including the double st to additional needles (as I use DPNs, I just leave the sts as they are and take another needle to work with). 

**Step 5**: Move the stitches on the main needle to the beginning again and work then in CC to end of main needle. CC yarn thread also remains behind the work.

**Step 6**: Turn work.

*Note: when you start working the next row with MC, make sure you pull thread just enough so both your double-stitch loops are equal in size.*

**Short row 2 (WS). Double brioche purl stitch:**

Using MC, work to 7 sts before end or row. Next st is brioche purl.

Transfer the yarn thread to the front of your work. 

**Step 1**: Insert the needle one row below the next st from back of the work.

**Step 2**: Grab the yarn and pull through and make a loop in the back of the knitting (as if it would be purl st).

**Step 3**: Place the made loop to the left-hand needle. Your MC yarn thread remains in the front of the work.

*From right to left: two sts and yarnover = they will be treated as a one st with yarnover*

**Step 4**: Transfer remaining sts including double-stitch to the additional needle. 


**Step 5**: Move the stitches on the main needle to the beginning again and work then in CC to end of main needle.


**Step 6**: Turn work.


**Short row 3 (RS)**

Using MC, work to 2 sts before previous turn. The next st is brioche knit.

Repeat Steps 1-6 from Short row 1.


**Short row 4 (WS)**

Using MC, work to 2 sts before previous turn. The next st is brioche purl.

Repeat Steps 1-6 from Short row 2.


For my sample I will repeat Short rows 3-4 once more.

![brioche_short_rows_9](../images/brioche_short_rows_9.webp)

All double-stitches are created. On side needles they are 1st, 3rd and 5th sttiches from main needle (in the middle).  
*Note: From creation and resolving perspective there is not difference if you make double-stitches in MC or in CC. The importart is that they are resolved in the same color as they are created. E.g., if the double-stitches are made in CC, on the resolving row in MC they are treated as one stitch and slipped with yarnover (when working sl1yo).*  
*From practical experience, in CC made double-stitches are less visible due to texture of brioche stitch.*

### Resolving double-stitches

**Last short row (RS)**

Using MC, work in brioche st to end of main needle. Then continue working from additional needle: work in established pattern, working brioche knit on double-stitch as it would be usual brioche knit with the yarnover.

Move the stitches on the main needle to the beginning again and work then in CC to end of main needle.


**Full row (WS)**

Using MC, work in brioche st to end of main needle. Then continue working from additional needle: work in established pattern, working brioche knit on double-stitch as it would be usual brioche knit with the yarnover.

Move the stitches on the main needle to the beginning again and work then in CC to end of main needle.


**Finished short rows**

I moved my sample to cable so it's shape would be more visible. From right side:
