Hi there!

Quick guide how to assemble cardigan knitted from bottom up.

<!--more-->

If you would rather watch video, how to asseble the body and sleeves before working the yoke, you can watch [this video on my Youtube channel](https://youtu.be/jrQOdeTs24E?si=TkOF5iGhirv85klY).

Here are all the parts worked:
- two sleeves on stitch holder
- and the body on the working needles.

# 1. Work the right front

# 2. Place the rigth underarm stitches on the holder
Place the stitches between green 1 and pink 2 on stitch holder (please take the correct number of stitches from the pattern, the picture is only indication).

# 3. Place the right sleeve underarm stitches on the holder
On my picture all sleeve stitches are currently on the holder. So I would transfer the first and last N stitches (before and after removable marker) to separate stitch holder and the rest of the stitches either on separate circular needle or to my left hand needle to be worked.

The stitches to be moved to holder are shown on my photo in blue 3.

Also, find the correct number of stitches in the pattern.

# 4. Work the right sleeve stitches
Place the remaining (shown in light grey 4) stitches on separate circular needle or on your left hand needle and work according to the pattern.
